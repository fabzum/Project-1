# Project-1
Description: using data obtained from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html our goal was to ascertain the potential price change that could occur when a host becomes a superhost in the NYC Airbnb market from March 2017 to March 2020.

Hypothesis: hosts increase their price after they become superhosts.

We used a paired t-test to determine the p-value associated with our host-to-superhost sample before-and-after the change in status occurred.

A paired t-test was used because our two samples from 2017 & 2020 had the same number of observations (host-to-superhost inflection points). Therefore, the two samples from different points in time could be paired with one another ... Before-and-after observations on the same subjects.
